            I've done lots of backpacking throughout the years, searching, following a calling,
            till experiencing an eye opening moment a few years ago in middle of the mighty Sahara desert.

          <div class="sentence2">
            Living with the nomads and their camels, observing them being constantly on the move, carrying only 
            just as much as they needed, only as much as the caravan could carry, made me rethink my approach on
            traveling and my way of living in general. The nomads would settle by unfolding a temporary camp, a 
            home in any area they wanted.
